This project is my spin on the Simon Game challenge project in Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy. I changed the colours, some of the styling, and images.
I also made the game responsive on mobile phones and tablets. 
Please share your opinions on it! I would really appreciate any tips I get too.
